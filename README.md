# Generalizability of machine learning in predicting antimicrobial resistance in E. coli: a multi-country case study in Africa

This repository contains the required python scripts and associated data to train and test Machine Learning (ML) models using most classifiers supported by the python ski-learn and associated packages in a Linux environment. The sample ML script for only one set of drug(ciprofloxacin) has been provided as jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) to enhance users ability to break the scripts down into manageable and understandable sections. 

## Associated Publication
The methodology underlying the framework has been detailed in the manuscript "Generalizability of machine learning in predicting antimicrobial resistance in E. coli: a multi-country case study in Africa" published in BMC Genomics.
