## Introduction
Bacterial isolates analyzed in this study were 42 multidrug resistant E. coli isolated from stool samples from both humans (n = 30) and cattle (n = 12) in pastoralist communities collected between January 2018-March 2019. Most of the isolates (41/42) were resistant to three or more antibiotics (multi-drug resistant) and 21/42 isolates were ESBL producers; 13/30 from human and 8/12 from cattle. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was carried out at the facilities of Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome trust, Kilifi, to determine the phylogenomic changes, virulence and resistant genes.
